<b> Useful RRAT Stuff </b>

As the name suggests this repository has, and will have more (!),
tools for dealing with Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs).

One thing you might want to do is get underlying periodcities when you
have a possibly very high nulling fraction. 

1. CHIME Repeater

CHIME reported a periodicity for one of their repeating FRBs here:
https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10275. To have a look at that one could
just run the data from their Extended Data Table 1, in the following
way, to get a plot like that in period.png

> python getper.py CHIME_seconds -p1 86400.0 -p2 8640000.0 -maxdiff 86400000.0 -pstep 8640.0 -days

run with a -h to see what the options are.

2. 12.1-s Pulsar

This code was used to find the period of the 12.1-s pulsar, discovered
in the SUPERB project. See here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04124

A good rule of thumb is that you should have at least 8 'TOAs' (so 28
pairs of TOAs) within a time window where they are all in phase wrt
respect to the uncertainty of the TOA determination
(i.e. sqrt(N)*sigma_TOA << P_trial) and then you will probably find
the right period. More and it is easier. Less and you migt not get it,
or might get a different harmonic. As it happens after the first
detection we thought the 12.1-s pulsar was a 6.05-s pulsar until we
re-observed it and had more pulses to play with.
